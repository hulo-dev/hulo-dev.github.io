Hello. I'm a Squarespace developer from Ukraine. 
The war is still going and people are still dying. 
Unexpectedly, one of the most deficit things is tourniquet.
It is a tight band used to stop the blood flow to a wound.

Friends of mine managed to set up non-profit production on a local furniture fabric. 
We can produce 500 - 1000 items per day. Price of one item is around $3.
If someone wants to donate directly for things that literally save lives please DM me. Any currency accepted.
Thanks a lot.
